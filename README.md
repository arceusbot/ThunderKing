# Kora
A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a Marie fork, Kora was created for personal use by [this person](https://t.me/Itz_kora). Feel free to add it to your groups though!

Can be found on telegram as [Kora](https://t.me/Koragroup_bot).

If you want to create your own bot, you can basically follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/tgbot/blob/master/README.md)
